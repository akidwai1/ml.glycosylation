# Project summary
Tool to extract GlyGen glycosylation information into an ML-ready format.

The project aims to extract GlyGen glycosylation information into an ML-ready format for predicting N-linked and O-linked glycosylation sites.

# Installation instructions
Go to https://api.glygen.org/supersearch/search/ 
Use the provided Curl command to query proteins with glycosylation sites. (However, instead of using curl we'll use Python version script.)
